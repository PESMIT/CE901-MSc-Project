# Proposal
The proposal for this thesis work is as follows:
>"Is it possible, to make traditional surveys more engaging/interesting for the casual user, through the use of video games"

This is an expanded consideration on the use of video games, and the application/development of video games for a specific purpose beyond traditional leisure activities.

# Sprint Session Plans
##Sprint 1: 01/05/18 - 08/05/18:
	- Initial Project Development
	- Establishing Main Functional Features
		- Unity Landscape
			- Placeholder Level (Room - 4 Walls - 0 Interactables)
			- Placeholder Character - (Simple Camera Controller - FPS Basis)
			- Placeholder Interactable - (Simple Sphere/Cube)
	- Establishing Unity Folder Variables/Assets
	
##Sprint 2: 08/05/18 - 15/05/18
	- Initial Project Development
	- Establishing Main Functional Features
		- Unity Landscape
			- Update Character Controls (True FPS - Amnesia-Style)
			- Update Character Camera (True FPS not ad-hoc)
			- Integrate Item Manipulation Placeholder
				- Amnesia/Penumbra Engine Style
				- Applied with Raycasts to object that is within -manipulatable- tagline
				- When Raycasts meet object within acceptable distance, lock raycast line as a solid weight.
				- Roll the object back and forth with mouse-wheel
					- Clamping distance as necessary.
				- Allow for rotation of object using the 'R' key
					- Adjust the rotation variable of target object.
